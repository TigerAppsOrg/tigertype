        <CollapsibleSection title="About TigerType">
          <p>
            TigerType is a real-time typing competition platform developed as a final project for Princeton University's COS 333 course. 
            Inspired by platforms like MonkeyType and TypeRacer, TigerType allows users to practice typing on their own, 
            create private lobbies with shareable invite codes to race against friends, or join a public queue to compete against 
            other Princeton users.
          </p>
          <p>
            Our goal is to provide a fun, engaging, and Princeton-themed environment for improving typing skills, 
            complete with performance analytics and friendly competition.
          </p>
        </CollapsibleSection>

        <CollapsibleSection title="Typing Mechanics">
          <p>
            Our typing interface provides:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Real-time Feedback:</strong> Immediate visual cues highlight correct and incorrect keystrokes</li>
            <li><strong>Error Handling:</strong> In <em>Timed</em> mode you do not need to go back and fix mistakes — you can keep typing; mistakes still reduce accuracy and adjusted WPM. In <em>Snippet</em> mode you must correct errors to continue progressing through the text.</li>
            <li><strong>Audio Feedback:</strong> Customizable keyboard sounds enhance the typing experience</li>
            <li><strong>Visible Progress:</strong> Clear indication of your position within the current text</li>
          </ul>
          
          <h4>Keyboard Shortcuts</h4>
          <p>
            TigerType offers several keyboard shortcuts to enhance your experience:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Tab:</strong> In practice mode, press Tab to get a new random snippet. Your previous progress will be recorded as a partial session for statistical purposes.</li>
            <li><strong>Escape:</strong> In practice mode, press Escape to restart the current snippet.</li>
            <li><strong>Ctrl+Backspace (or Cmd+Backspace on Mac):</strong> Delete the entire word you're currently typing.</li>
          </ul>
          
          <h4>Inactivity and System Rules</h4>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Player Minimum:</strong> Quick Match and Private Lobbies require a minimum of 2 players to start a race.</li>
            <li><strong>Ready Status:</strong> All players must click "Ready" to begin a race.</li>
            <li><strong>Inactivity Warning:</strong> If you are the only player who has not clicked "Ready" for 60 seconds, you will receive an inactivity warning.</li>
            <li><strong>Inactivity Kick:</strong> If you remain inactive for an additional 15 seconds after the warning, you will be automatically removed from the lobby to prevent holding up other players.</li>
            <li><strong>Anti-Cheat Measures:</strong> Pasting text is disabled during races to maintain fair competition.</li>
            <li><strong>Public Lobby Capacity:</strong> Public lobbies have no player cap. Private lobbies are limited to 10 players.</li>
          </ul>

          <h4>Stats Calculation</h4>
          <p>
            Your typing performance is measured primarily by Words Per Minute (WPM) and Accuracy.
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>WPM:</strong> Calculated based on the standard definition where one 'word' equals 5 characters (including spaces and punctuation). We count the number of correct characters you type and divide by 5, then normalize this to a per-minute rate based on the time elapsed.</li>
            <li><strong>Accuracy:</strong> Calculated as the percentage of correctly typed characters out of the total characters attempted in the snippet.</li>
            <li><strong>Partial Sessions:</strong> Even if you don't complete a typing test (e.g., pressing Tab to restart), we still record the words you typed for your personal statistics and the platform's overall statistics.</li>
          </ul>
          
          <h4>Creating a Private Lobby</h4>
          <p>
            To race specifically against friends:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Select "Create Lobby" from the main menu</li>
            <li>Customize your race settings (if desired)</li>
            <li>Click "Create"</li>
            <li>You'll receive a unique 6-character invite code (e.g., "A7B2C9")</li>
            <li>Share this code with friends who can use it to join your private race</li>
            <li>Once everyone has joined, all players must click "Ready"</li>
            <li>When all players are ready, a 5-second countdown will begin</li>
          </ul>

          <h4>Joining a Quick Match</h4>
          <p>
            To race against random opponents:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Select "Quick Match" from the main menu</li>
            <li>You'll be placed in a public queue with other users</li>
            <li>Once at least one other player joins, click "Ready"</li>
            <li>When all players are ready, a 5-second countdown will begin</li>
            <li>If you don't click "Ready" within 60 seconds, you'll receive an inactivity warning</li>
            <li>If you remain inactive for an additional 15 seconds, you'll be removed from the lobby</li>
          </ul>

          <h4>Typing Content</h4>
          <p>
            TigerType features a diverse collection of typing material:

        </CollapsibleSection>
        <CollapsibleSection title="Understanding Statistics">
          <h4>Platform Statistics</h4>
          <p>
            Our platform showcases the following key statistics on the landing page:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Races Completed:</strong> The total number of typing races and timed tests that have been fully completed by all users. This counts only sessions where users typed the entire text or finished the timed duration.</li>
            <li><strong>Tests Started:</strong> The total number of typing sessions initiated by all users, including both completed sessions and those that weren't finished. This includes when a user starts typing but presses TAB to restart or abandons a session before completion.</li>
            <li><strong>Words Typed:</strong> The total number of words typed across all sessions on TigerType. We count words from both completed races and partial sessions, so every word you type contributes to this statistic, even if you don't finish a test.</li>
            <li><strong>Avg. WPM:</strong> The average typing speed across all completed tests on the platform.</li>
            <li><strong>Active Tigers:</strong> The number of Princeton users who have registered on TigerType.</li>
          </ul>

          <h4>Personal Statistics</h4>
          <p>
            Your profile page shows both standard and detailed statistics:
          </p>
          
          <p><strong>Standard Stats:</strong></p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Races Completed:</strong> The number of typing tests you've fully completed.</li>
            <li><strong>Average WPM:</strong> Your average typing speed across all completed tests.</li>
            <li><strong>Average Accuracy:</strong> Your average typing accuracy across all completed tests.</li>
            <li><strong>Fastest Speed:</strong> Your highest recorded WPM from any completed test.</li>
          </ul>
          
          <p><strong>Detailed Stats:</strong></p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Total Sessions Started:</strong> All typing sessions you've initiated, whether completed or not.</li>
            <li><strong>Sessions Completed:</strong> The number of tests you've finished without restarting.</li>
            <li><strong>Total Words Typed:</strong> All words you've typed on TigerType, including those from sessions you didn't complete. Each keystroke counts!</li>
            <li><strong>Completion Rate:</strong> The percentage of started tests that you've completed. This is calculated as (Sessions Completed / Total Sessions Started) × 100%.</li>
          </ul>
          
          <h4>How Data Is Tracked</h4>
          <p>
            TigerType carefully tracks your typing activity using several methods:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Completed Tests:</strong> When you finish a typing test, we record your WPM, accuracy, completion time, and the snippet you typed.</li>
            <li><strong>Timed Tests:</strong> For timed mode, we track how many words you successfully typed during the set duration.</li>
            <li><strong>Partial Sessions:</strong> When you press TAB to restart a test or otherwise abandon a session before completion, we still count the words you typed up to that point. This ensures you get credit for all your typing practice, even if you decide to restart.</li>
          </ul>
          
          <p>
            All these metrics help you understand your typing performance comprehensively and show your improvement over time.
